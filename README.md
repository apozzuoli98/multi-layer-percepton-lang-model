# multi-layer-percepton-lang-model
Multi-layer perceptron which learns to predict characters based on the last three characters </br>

Learned from Andrej Karpathy tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I) </br>
and from Bengio et al. 2003 (https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf). </br>

There are also some modifications from the tutorial including some tuning of hyperparameters and the ability to save the model to be loaded later.
